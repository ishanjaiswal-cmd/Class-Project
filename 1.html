    <CENTER><h1>The Nine Billions Names Of Godâ€™s<h5>-Charles Clarke</h5></h1></CENTER>
    <div class="header">
    <h2>A computer salesman in a Manhattan, New York, office has a unique customer who is a Tibetan lama. The Lama is a Buddhist religious leader who wants to purchase an "Automatic Sequence Computer" to produce the nine billion names of God in a few months. The salesman agrees to sell the computer and sends the American engineers George and Chuck to Tibet to watch over the device until it completes its task.
        Two months later George and Chuck are nearing the end of their time in Tibet. The Buddhist monks have treated them kindly. Yet Chuck has a startling revelation when he learns the monks believe that the universe will end when the computer completes its task. The engineers fear that the monks will turn on them when the universe fails to end after the computer finishes printing the last name of God. They hatch a plan to slow down the computer just enough to make sure that they are long gone by the time the computer completes its program.
        The plan works and the engineers are able to make it to the plane that will take them home just as the computer prints its last page of names. At that moment they look up to discover that the stars are blinking out of existence.</h2>
